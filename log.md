# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created first round of HTML pages for HiiUniversity.

**Thoughts:** I feel I am understanding HTML structure and the tags associated therewith. Page looks poor without CSS. Excited about learning how to make this look better!
